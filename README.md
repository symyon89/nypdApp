# NYPD API Implementation

- *This is a basic implementation of https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/qgea-i56i.json*

## Getting started

- This sample application provides a REST API using Spring Boot, so it is very easy to make it work as standalone server.
- Customazie your data in application.properties

### Local deployment 
    -  Run mvn package, to build jar executable

## Authentication
- This API is a completely open API. No authentication is required to query and get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just GET-ing the data. If you find a mistake in the data, then tweet the author or email him.

## Endpoints
- Enpoints are exposex with swagger on link http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/
